This program shows 10 persons information taken from the results.txt file.
It gives 5 options on what we can do with that information:

1 - Shows the oldest person on the list
2 - Shows all the people on the list of the chosen city
3 - Writes all male information into a file called results.txt
4 - Writes information of people of a chosen city & older than 30 to results.txt
5 - Writes the last result in a file"

These options will continue to show up after chosing and executing any of 
the 5 selections. The 6th option finishes the program:

6 - Finish
