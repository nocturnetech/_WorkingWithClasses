#_WorkingWithClasses

This is a project that outputs 10 different persons information to the console and let's you perform 5 different manipulations:

1. Shows the oldest person on the list
2. Shows all the people on the list of the chosen city
3. Writes all male information into a file called results.txt
4. Writes information of people of a chosen city & older than 30 to results.txt
5. Writes the last result in a file"

The information of each person is acquired from the residents.txt file.

These options will continue to show up after choosing and executing any of 
the 5 selections. The 6th option finishes the program:

6 - Finish
